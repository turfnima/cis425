problems:
i got the setter, getter for the rotation, translation, scale of a object.
but I can't figure out how to paint an abstract object at a known location.

That is, if I have an object that could be anything (a cylinder, a cube, or the combination of a cylinder and a cube), and I want to paint this  object at( 1, 0,0)
how would I do that with a function call?

I experimented with "function pointers", however I couldn't figure out because I don't know how to call that function.

if I get pass this then I would be able to transform any object that passed on using functions.

I have been very busy with the interview, good thing I did get through the final round, it looks like I almost got it.

now back to my project:
I need to redo the cube, cylinder.
I have to use a graph algorithm to get the connected dots and edges.
that means I will be able to export and import in .obj format.

this also means I need a vector to temporally save all the printed objects.
so whenever making a print, the coords and commands of the object will be pushed in.
when exporting, that list of objects will be saved.

a headache question is how should I solve the mouse select and drag.
I have heard I can use ray casting.
I need a lot of time to practice this until I can make use of it.
I suppose this should take 8 hours.
