problems:
i got the setter, getter for the rotation, translation, scale of a object.
but I can't figure out how to paint an abstract object at a known location.

That is, if I have an object that could be anything (a cylinder, a cube, or the combination of a cylinder and a cube), and I want to paint this  object at( 1, 0,0)
how would I do that with a function call?

I experimented with "function pointers", however I couldn't figure out because I don't know how to call that function.

if I get pass this then I would be able to transform any object that passed on using functions.
